# LWC-SLDS-standard-components
An open source implementation of the SLDS standard components for Lightning Web Components.


SDLS contains [blueprints](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/components/overview/) for a lot of Salesforce standard components, but they are do not contain Javascript, such that you can not use them without a lot of work in your LWC apps.
In this repository I will share my implementations of these blueprint containing the logic I need in my projects.
